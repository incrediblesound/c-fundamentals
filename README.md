c-fundamentals
==============

This is a repository of programs that I will write as I learn the fundamentals of c.    

file-write: uses a shell command to open a new file and writes data to it.    
notes: prompts the user for a name, creates a text file with that name, and then continuously prompts the user for input until the word "end" is entered. A convenient way to make a todo list from the console, hope to add a read function next.
