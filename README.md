c-fundamentals
==============

This is a repository of programs that I will write as I learn the fundamentals of c.    

<strong>file-write:</strong> uses a shell command to open a new file and writes data to it.    
<strong>notes:</strong> prompts the user for a name, creates a text file with that name, and then continuously prompts the user for input until the word "end" is entered. If run with the name of a text file, it prints each line of the text file as a numbered list. A convenient way to make and read todo lists from the console.    
<strong>trees:</strong>Binary trees insert and search.
